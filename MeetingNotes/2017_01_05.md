Six weeks till ICFP.  Forcing function.

What are the contributions for an ICFP paper?  

 * They've been talking about a theorem statement.

 * Implementation artifact -- patching GHC.
  - run a server, change the worst-case latency?
    (e.g. using the FFI for msg queue, no RTS change)
  - 

Simon's questioning the value proposition if the backend isn't
changed.  Instead the argument becomes: making manual memory mgmt
safer.

Do we still need hard numbers?  SPJ: yes, still helpful.
It being a realworld example is most important.

Will the paper say "this is real; it is in GHC"?  That's a nice cherry 
on top if everything else is convincing.

Only type-inference is modified currently, not Core.


Question: I was wondering about how the memcached style motivation
works if you cannot have multiple threads storing a pointer to a
foreign data structure.




Related work:
-------------

Relating to other linear type systems... weights on bindings instead
of types.  Not too many type systems that did this.  First such system
for a lazy language.  Polymorphism on weight is new (for a linear type
system, been done in uniqueness type systems).

Colin Runciman paper in the early 90s was probably the last paper to
look at linear+lazy.

SPJ: The reader may think: having weights on bindings makes it
different, but is it better?  Need to argue that.

(Several claims on this front... simplicity, ease of implementation,
code reuse.)


TODOs:
------

 * a couple experimental results for the introduction

 * start a fresh document in ICFP format

 * what else?

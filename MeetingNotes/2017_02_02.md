============================


(++) - compile two versions (not 4?)

(++) :_w [a] -o [a] -o [a]

(++) xs_1 ys_w  :_1 [a]
(++) xs_w ys_1  :_1 [a] 

id :: a -o a

id x_w :_w A

--------------------------------
Typing context
{ f :_1 A -o (B -o C)
  x :_w A
  y :_1 B 
  G :_w C ->_w D }

G (f x y)

  
Gamma |- t :_w A  iff 
  exists Delta such that w Gamma = Delta and Delta |- t : A

Figure 2:
  G |- t : A
Can be thought of as:
  G |- t :_1 A

Confession (RRN):
  I’m thinking of weight of subexpressions in terms of a flattened A-normal form:  
  f :_s A  ->_p  B ->_q  C
  x :_t A
  (f x) y
  let tmp :_(s /\ t) B = f x in tmp y
  
Every closed expression CAN be given an omega weight.  (Promotion only depends on context, closed have no context.)

(+#) : Int# -o Int# -o Int# ??
G (case x of I# x -> I# (x +# 1#)) Here!!!!!!!<<-----------------
Case x of I# x -> G (I# (x +# 1#)) <- works with x:_1 A

reverse :_w [a] -o [a]
G (reverse xs)

x :_1 Handle  |-   many x :_w  Handle
many : ???
G (many x)

-- Working
x :_1 Handle  |-   many x : Bang Handle
many : Handle -> Bang Handle
Case many x of
 Bang x’ -> G x’

But not
G (case many x of Bang x’ -> x’)


Question (Theorem?): is there a maximally-linear subscript annotation for a given program text?  (And does it form a lattice?)
Answer: NO!  (Classic result: can’t generally infer weights.)

Can we construct P, such that source locations l1, l2  in P are multiplicity expressions (subscripts), and l1=1,l2=w is ok, plus l1=w,l2=1 is ok, but l1=l2=1 is AN ERROR.

-- There may be a “principal weighting” without polymorphic weights.
let _ :_l1 _ = _
    _ :_l2 _ = _
in _



SPJ: Possible suggestion
openChannel :: IO InputChan
getMsg :: InputChan ->  IO Message
closeChannel :: InputChan -> IO ()

^ show how linearity accomplishes this

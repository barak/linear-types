=================================================


Initialization of data constructors:
-------------------------------------------------------

    Data T = MkT Int# Float# 

First question: can you safely initialize haskell data within some
foreign storage?

```Haskell
    let p1 = $startWritingMkT basePtr
        p2 = $writeHeader ? p1
        p3 = $writeInt# p2 3#
        p4 = $writeFloat# p3 4.4#
        t  = $finalize p4
      …
      -- Here's one way that we are doing this now, attaching protocols
      -- to pointer types, "Has" (read) and "Needs" (write):
      Ptr T ~ Has(T), Needs([T1,T2...],T)
                           ~= T1 -o T2 -o … -o T
      finish :: Needs([],T) -> T
```

Second question, regarding:

 * Mutable structs in Haskell:
   https://github.com/simonmar/ghc-proposals/blob/mutable-fields/proposals/0000-mutable-fields.rst

NOT COVERED in that proposal: unpacked mutable products within
products (like C++ classes with recursive initialization of members).


```Haskell
    -- In the mutable structs proposal:
    data T’ where
       MkT :: Int# -> mutable Float# -> IO T’
     do t <- MkT 3 4.4
        case t of 
          MkT n fr -> writeRef fr 5.5

    -- No story for this; doesn’t work:
    Data S = MkS { a::(mutable Int#), t:: {-#UNPACK#-} T’ } -- not allowed

```

Two proposals:


 * A bunch of new syntax. Like C++ initializers.  Too much.
 * Linear types.  Destination passing.

```Haskell
    Dest X = X -o 1
	-- Does Dest T then make sense for compound type T?  
	Dest T ~ (Dest Int#, Dest Float#)?
                      
           “matchDestT” :: Dest T -o (Dest Int X Dest Float)

           idT :: (Dest T -o 1) -o T
           mkT’ :: (Dest Int -o Dest Float -o 1) -o T
```

```Haskell
    -- Hypothetical:
    Data T where
      MkT :: (Dest Int# -o MutDest Float# -o IO ()) -o T
    Data S where 
      MkS :: (MutDest Int# -o Dest T -o 1) -o S
     case t of 
       MkT n fr -> …
```

```Haskell
    -- Here’s a really extreme version where you directly get the function which you call to copy values out:
     case t of 
       MkT f -> do f d1 d2  -- ignore linearity??
                   _ <- read d1 -- (have the 1st field)
              
```

Fusion questions:
--------------------------------------------

```Haskell
    data Tree = Leaf Int | Node Tree Tree
    data Tree where
      Leaf :: Int  -o Tree
      Node :: Tree -o Tree -o Tree


    Add1 :: Tree -o Tree
    add1 (Leaf n)   = Leaf (n+1)
    add1 (Node x y) = Node (add1 x) (add1 y)

    -- Question: can you fuse this?:
       add1 (add1 tr0)
```


```Haskell
    -- Supercompilation-style deforestation would just inline away:
     Let f = case (case tr0 of 
                    Leaf n   -> Leaf (n+1)
                    Node x y -> Node (_ x) (_ y))
              of
                Leaf n   -> Leaf (n+1)
                Node x y -> Node (_ x) (_ y)


        -- squish case-of-case, duplicate code
        Case tr0 of 
          Leaf n -> case Leaf (n+1) of 
                      Leaf n -> Leaf (n+1)
                      …
      -- case of known constructor:
       Case tr0 of 
          Leaf n -> Leaf (n+2) 
          ...
```

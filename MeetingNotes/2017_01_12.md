----------------------------

Simon: if I just had a language with a primitive malloc/free, we
wouldn't need subscripts on the down arrows.  Why do we need them
here?

Why not make alloc a primitive?
Currently all alloc primitives end with `Bang _`.

Simon: The subscript on the down arrow is the thing that screws up the
implementation.  It would be a big simplification to leave it out.

Gap between this semantics and what's implemented... we don't
implement the subscript on the down arrow (i.e. execution modes /
Case-Bang.).

Let_1 and Bang/case-bang currently work together to achieve a certain effect (e.g. in alloc for Queue), an alternative, combined form this could perhaps take is:

    let_one x = e in Bang e'

Here the body is always forced, and has type (Bang t).

Typing rule: 


      G|-e        D,x|-e’
    -------------------------
    G+wD |- let_one x = e in e’

Simon: A semantics which uses the subscript only by getting stuck would be fine.  But this current, more general version requires an extra proof that the corners cut in the current implementation don’t compromise its soundness.

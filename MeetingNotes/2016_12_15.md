[2016.12.08] Discussing applications of linearity

Questions:


   1. RRN: What happened with the webserver example?  It was explained but I didn’t see the solution with this type system?
   2. RRN: lifetime of linear heap as a whole.  Can you have a top-level binding with linear weight?  (I assume no.)  If we ignore threads for a moment, when a top level (static f) function returns “Bang a”, can we guarantee that everything on the linear heap is freed by that point?
      1. (Wondering about options for implementing malloc/free and connections to region.)
   1. RRN: what’s the low level interface for implementing constructors and destructors?  These need to do something completely different for files and for memory allocations…
   2. RRN: Why does Queue’s “delete” take a Msg, not some kind of Key?
   3. Simon asks about “free :: Queue -o ()” -- how to ensure it is called / unit is consumed? (see code below… need to case on the unit)


Comments:


   1. RRN: Backwards compatibility story seems quite good.  You can have a Prelude full of linear types and never see any difference as long as you don’t kick things off with a “linear value”.
   2. RRN: User friendliness: design for someone who doesn’t know linear logic, i.e. in name choices and error messages (“Bang”, weight, omega, “exhausted”).
   3. SPJ: A major use-case is to make sure that we (the programmer) explicitly deallocate external resources, and do not use them after they have been so deallocated.  That is, reject some bad programs.  This part has NO EFFECT on code gen or runtime system.

Code:

```Haskell
-- What forces us to use x?  It’s weight is 1.  This is invalid:
alloc $ \q -> let x = free q in Bang 2
-- Of course, this doesn’t use ‘q’ either: 
alloc $ \q -> Bang 2
-- RRN: Don’t we normally call these “with” functions in Haskell?  withQueue?


-- Simon: what about a monadic interface?  Ergonomics of linear threading of value versions… is there a way to put some sugar on this using the new type system?  (Achieve interface similar to type state solutions but with a different type system.)


alloc $\q -> do { ...; free q; return 2 }
-- Simon: that's more what I'd expect
alloc :: M Queue
push  :: Msg -> Queue -> M ()  -- RRN: this looks like borrowing...
free  :: Queue -o M ()
-- Type of bind?  Rebindable syntax?
-- Simon: with file handles, it would be a big win if the interface didn’t change much but you got more of a safety guarantee.  IO would still be needed to serialize reads and writes.
-- Verbose version:
getChar :: FH -o IO (Char, FH)
-- Jean Philippe has a version where you only use “IO ()”... double negation
-- CPS version:
getChar :: FH -o ((Char,FH) -o IO ()) -> IO ()


Newtype LIO a = (a -o IO ()) -> IO ()


getChar :: FH -o LIO (Char, FH)


   do (x, fh1) <- getChar fh0
      (y, fh2) <- getChar fh1
-- RN: Shadowing is fine, right?  Maybe syntactic sugar could expand to that:
   do (x, fh) <- getChar fh
      (y, fh) <- getChar fh


     p <-- e x
     p2 <-- e2 x
means
     (p,x) <- e x where x1 is chosen to be fresh


RN: implementing free function for file handles? 
option (1): unsafePerformIO - expensive
option (2): some primop that translates linear guarantees into raw (unsafe) IO actions?




-- RN question 2 from above
-- GC heap does not point to linear heap.
-- Do we ever know the linear heap is EMPTY:
f :: Int -o Bang Float


main = case (static f) 3 of
         Bang x -> print x


main = print ((static f) 3)




-- Discussing scratch regions:


-- Type error: 
withRegion r $ \ 
  let ls     =_1 [1,2,3]
      Bang n = copy (sum ls)
  in 
    Bang (3, n)


-- Fixed version:
withRegion r $ \ 
  let ls =_1 [1,2,3] in
  case copy (sum ls) of 
    Bang n -> Bang (3, n)


-- Final question: in stage 3 of the plan, how would one select which malloc/free implementation to use, or for that matter how could this region story coexist with the basic malloc/free use case?
```
